# Folk CRM: The Lightweight Relationship Manager That Actually Makes Sense

You know that feeling when you open a new CRM and immediately want to close it? Yeah, we've all been there. Traditional CRMs can feel like trying to fly a spaceship when all you wanted was a bike. That's where Folk CRM comes in—think of it as the friend who helps you organize your contacts without making you feel like you need a degree in rocket science.

## What's Folk CRM Actually About?

Folk started with a problem that probably sounds familiar: the team at eFounders had a massive network but no good way to actually use it. Traditional CRMs were built for big sales teams with complex pipelines, not for people who just wanted to keep track of relationships and actually stay in touch.

So in 2019, they built their own thing. Folk isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's a relationship management tool that feels more like a smart spreadsheet than an enterprise monster. And honestly? That's exactly what a lot of people need.

## The Good Stuff (What Folk Does Well)

**It's Actually Easy to Use**

Here's the thing about Folk—you can probably figure it out without watching a single tutorial. It's got that Notion-style vibe where everything just kind of makes sense. You're not clicking through seventeen menus to add a contact or update a note.

The interface is clean. Like, actually clean, not "we hid all the features so it looks clean" clean. You've got your contacts, your groups, your pipelines, and that's pretty much it. No clutter, no overwhelming dashboards screaming at you with charts you'll never look at.

**Adding Contacts is Stupid Simple**

Folk has this Chrome extension called folkX, and it's kind of magical. You're on LinkedIn, you see someone interesting, one click and boom—they're in your CRM. It works on Gmail, Twitter (sorry, X), and a bunch of other platforms.

And here's where it gets better: Folk has this enrichment feature. You add a contact with just their email, and Folk can find their phone number, job title, company info, all that jazz. You get 500 enrichments per month on the Standard plan, 1,000 on Premium.

**The AI Stuff Actually Helps**

Folk has these "Magic Fields" powered by AI. Sounds gimmicky, right? But they're actually useful. You can use them to:

- Auto-generate personalized emails based on contact info
- Clean up messy data
- Categorize contacts automatically
- Pull information from websites

Think of it like having a super organized assistant who doesn't mind doing the boring stuff. You get 2,000 magic field uses per month on Standard, 5,000 on Premium.

**Collaboration Without the Headaches**

If you're working with a team, Folk lets everyone see what's happening without stepping on each other's toes. You can share groups, see who contacted whom, add notes, tag teammates. It's collaborative without being chaotic.

The Premium plan gives you advanced roles and permissions, which is nice if you want to make sure your intern doesn't accidentally delete your entire client list.

## The Not-So-Good Stuff (Let's Be Honest)

**No Mobile App**

Yeah, you read that right. In 2026, Folk still doesn't have a mobile app. They've got a desktop app, but if you're someone who lives on your phone, this might be a dealbreaker. You can use it in a mobile browser, but let's be real—that's not the same.

**Limited Automation**

If you're looking for complex workflow automation, Folk isn't going to cut it. It's got basic email sequences and some automation through Zapier and Make, but it's not competing with the heavy hitters here.

**Price Can Add Up**

Folk isn't the cheapest option out there. At $25/user/month (or $20 if you pay yearly), it's pricier than some alternatives. And if you need the Premium features like dashboards and email sequences, you're looking at $50/month ($40 yearly).

For a solo founder or tiny team, that's fine. But if you're scaling up, those per-seat costs stack up fast.

## Who Should Actually Use Folk?

Folk is perfect if you're:

- A solo entrepreneur or small team (under 50 people)
- Someone who values simplicity over features
- Doing a lot of social selling on LinkedIn
- Coming from using spreadsheets or Notion as your "CRM"
- Not worried about having a mobile app

Folk is **not** for you if:

- You need robust workflow automation
- You're managing complex sales processes
- You want detailed analytics and forecasting
- You need a mobile app
- You're planning to scale beyond 50+ people

## The Pricing Breakdown

## How to Save Money on Folk

Here's where things get interesting. Folk doesn't advertise huge discounts everywhere, but there are ways to save:

## What People Actually Say About It

The reviews are pretty consistent. People love how easy Folk is to use. The LinkedIn integration gets mentioned constantly—it's one of those features that just works.

The complaints? Mostly about what's missing—no mobile app, limited automation, and the price adding up as teams grow. Some users also mention duplicate contacts being an issue when syncing from multiple sources.

On G2, Folk has solid ratings, with users particularly praising:
- The clean, intuitive interface
- One-click contact enrichment
- LinkedIn Chrome extension
- Quick customer support

## The Bottom Line

Folk CRM is like that friend who keeps things simple and straightforward. It's not trying to do everything, and that's actually its strength.

If you're drowning in a sea of contacts and just want something that helps you stay organized without requiring a PhD in CRM management, Folk is worth a look. The 14-day trial gives you plenty of time to see if it fits your workflow.

The pricing isn't the cheapest, but for small teams who value ease of use and time saved, it can be worth it. Just make sure you're cool with the limitations—especially that no-mobile-app situation.

And hey, if you're going to try it, might as well grab one of those discount codes and save yourself some cash.
